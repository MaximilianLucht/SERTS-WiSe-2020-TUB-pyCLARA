Implementation
===============

Start with the configuration:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   
   config
   
You can run the code by typing::

	$ python geoclustering_code.py
	
``geoclustering_code.py`` includes the main functions for the code, which are explained in the following sections.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   
   geoclustering_code
   
For the hierarchical clustering of the transmission network, use the following scripts:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   clustering_transmission
   connecting_transmission_islands

Helping functions for the models are included in ``helping_functions.py``.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   
   helping_functions
